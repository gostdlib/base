// ShardedMap is a map that is sharded by a hash of the key. This allows for multiple readers and writers to
// access the map without blocking as long as they are accessing different maps. This is useful for when you
// have a large number of keys and you want to reduce contention on the map. This map also shrinks with deleted
// keys, so it will not grow indefinitely like a standard map. This is faster than sync.Map in most cases
// (even in 1.24) and is more memory efficient. This is thread safe, unless you are using the All() method, which
// is not thread safe.
